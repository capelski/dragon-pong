# Dragon Pong

The company where I worked back then had a ping pong table but not a ranking system to track the scores. How could we possibly know who was the best player? I had to implement this website using Angular and PHP + Excel to find it out! (No, I wasn't working at Dragon Ball Inc. I have changed the name to not mention the company)

P.S. Wondering about the get-express-app file and the URLs $modena query parameter? Check out [modena](https://github.com/L3bowski/modena-v2) to learn how to automatically expose multiple isolated express apps on a single server
