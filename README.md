# Dragon Pong

The company where I worked back then had a ping pong table but not a ranking system to track the scores. How could we possibly know who was the best player? I had to implement this website using Angular and PHP + Excel to find it out! (No, I wasn't working at Dragon Ball Inc. I have changed the name to not mention the company)
